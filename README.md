# Hello, Cost Explorer!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Cost Explorer!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-cost-explorer) blog post. 

This episode: AWS Cost Explorer and cost analysis. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce AWS Cost Explorer and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to perform query AWS charges. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 

## Our Hello, Cost Explorer Project

We will first get familiar with Cost Explorer in the AWS console. Then, we'll query it from the AWS CLI. Finally, we'll write a .NET program to get cost and usage information from the Cost Explorer API.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
